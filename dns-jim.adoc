                 DOMAIN NAMES - CONCEPTS AND FACILITIES



1. STATUS OF THIS MEMO

This RFC is an introduction to the Domain Name System (DNS), and omits
many details which can be found in a companion RFC, "Domain Names -
Implementation and Specification" [RFC-1035].  That RFC assumes that the
reader is familiar with the concepts discussed in this memo.

A subset of DNS functions and data types constitute an official
protocol.  The official protocol includes standard queries and their
responses and most of the Internet class data formats (e.g., host
addresses).
....

[.notes]
--
* The DNS Ur-document.
* Describes a protocol operating over UDP and TCP.
* Not much thought of security or privacy.
--

== DNS

* A consistent namespace used for referring to resources.
* Maintained in a distributed manner.
* Local caching to improve performance.

[.notes]
--
I'm taking a quick tour through the basics
of how DNS works, largely so we can get the terminology.

I'm only looking at items of interest to application devs.
There's a chunk of stuff on server management which I'm
not going to discuss.
--

== The domain namespace
image::domain-hierarchy.png[Domain Hierarchy]

[.notes]
--
Let's look at the namespace first.

The containers outline the division of responsibility for
parts of the namespace. Note that a single zone can have multiple
levels. In the UK, .co.uk and .org.uk are all in one zone.

The top of the tree is the root zone. This has a null name.
Note FQDN ending in '.'.

== Delegation of authority

cross-cutting link to/from verisign.ca.

== Root servers

* A fixed list of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for 13 servers.
** `a.root-servers.net` .. `m.root-servers.net`

[.notes]
--
Fixed set of 13 root server addresses. Why 13?

  University of Maryland, NASA Ames Research Centre, Internet Systems Consortium, Inc.,

[.notes]
--
J root was originally Network Solutions, now taken over by VeriSign.
--

== Recursive servers

* Search the hierarchy to resolve queries
* Cache results and reuse them in future queries
* Typically run by ISP...
* ... or 3rd party, e.g. Google, OpenDNS

== Stub resolver

* Your local name resolution
* Typically using recursive server(s) supplied by DHCP

| PTR | Pointer to canonical name (for address)
| SRV | Location of servers providing given service
| TXT | General textual information
| SOA | Start of Authority record for zone
|===

[.notes]
--
Basic set of RR types. There are lots more, many/most are historical relics.
--

== Transmission

[%step]
* DNS uses UDP
* Except when it uses TCP

[.notes]
--
By default DNS uses UDP. However, in IPv4 the minimum MTU
is 576 bytes. Generally 512 bytes is considered maximum for
unfragmentable UDP payload.

So RFC1035 limits DNS replies to 512 bytes. If you go over that,
you may drop back to TCP. In TCP, you send a 2 byte header giving
the length of the DNS message.

Some queries (e.g. NS for .) generate a list of servers; 13
with A records fits into single UDP with some spare
space. There are also 13 gtld servers for .com/.net.

TCP support was only made mandatory in 2011. However, UDP
usage is preferred as much as possible, avoid connection
setup/teardown overhead on servers.

IPv6 has much larger minimum MTU, 1280. So expect more
root servers in the future.

                  Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0)

...

Abstract

   The Domain Name System's wire protocol includes a number of fixed
   fields whose range has been or soon will be exhausted and does not
   allow clients to advertise their capabilities to servers.  This
   document describes backward compatible mechanisms for allowing the
   protocol to grow.
....

[.notes]
--
Obsoleted by RFC6891 (2013), which discarded a funky label format.
--

== EDNS0

* Extends RCODE range and number of flags.
* Mechanism to allow larger UDP messages. This is necessary because of an
  increase in DNS RR sizes:
** AAAA records
** Large TXT records
** DNSSEC

[%notitle]
== EDNS0 OPT RR

[.minspace,cols="15,25,60"]
|===
| NAME | | Always 00
| TYPE | 16 bits | OPT (41)
| CLASS | 16 bits | Sender UDP payload size
| TTL | 32 bits | uint8 extended RCODE
| | | uint8 version (0)
| | | uint16 flags
| RDLEN | 16 bits | Length of RDATA
| RDATA | | Options. Any number of:
| | | uint16 Option Code
| | | uint16 Option length
| | | Option data
|===

[.notes]
--
Extended RCODE is upper 8 bits of extended 12-bit RCODE.

There are currently no officially defined option codes.

The major point of interest is the ability of a sender to indicate the
largest UDP payload size it thinks it will accept.  This allows other
side to try that size and hopefully avoid fallback to TCP.

                      Client Subnet in DNS Queries

Abstract

   This document describes an Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0)
   option that is in active use to carry information about the network
   that originated a DNS query and the network for which the subsequent
   response can be cached.  Since it has some known operational and
   privacy shortcomings, a revision will be worked through the IETF for
   improvement.

               DNS Security Introduction and Requirements

[omitted]

   The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) add data origin
   authentication and data integrity to the Domain Name System.  This
   document introduces these extensions and describes their capabilities
   and limitations.  This document also discusses the services that the
   DNS security extensions do and do not provide.

DNSSEC first started in 1995. And it took a LONG time to get
pretty right. The current base RFCs published 2005.

And the root zone didn't get signed until 2010.

** Checking Disabled (CD): Client is OK to receive non-authenticated data

== Using DNSSEC

* If your resolver does DNSSEC:
** AD indicates data is authenticated
** SERVFAIL if authentication fails

* Can your stub resolver validate?
* Can your resolving server validate?

       Specification for DNS over Transport Layer Security (TLS)

Abstract

   This document describes the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) to
   provide privacy for DNS.  Encryption provided by TLS eliminates
   opportunities for eavesdropping and on-path tampering with DNS
   queries in the network, such as discussed in RFC 7626.  In addition,
   this document specifies two usage profiles for DNS over TLS and
   provides advice on performance considerations to minimize overhead
   from using TCP and TLS with DNS.
....

[%notitle]
== DoT modes

[%step]
* *Opportunistic* mode
** Try 853, fall back to normal DNS on port 53 (Do53?) otherwise
** Defeats passive surveillance
* *Strict* mode
** Configure server SPKI fingerprint(s) and verify
** Prevents redirects, increases trust in service
* Transport data integrity - can't inject spoofed responses

[.notes]

TCP or TLS prevent amplification attacks.

Note TLS SNI still leaks.

== DoT support

* Clients: Android Pie, systemd, Stubby
** Native Windows/macOS/iOS support still needed
* Servers: Unbound, Knot resolver, dnsdist, Bind via proxy
* November 2017: Quad9 public DNS (9.9.9.9)
* March 2018: Cloudflare public DNS (1.1.1.1)
* January 2019: Google public DNS (8.8.8.8)

             DNS Query Name Minimisation to Improve Privacy

Abstract

   This document describes a technique to improve DNS privacy, a
   technique called "QNAME minimisation", where the DNS resolver no
   longer sends the full original QNAME to the upstream name server.
....

== QNAME minimisation

[%steps]
* DNSOP WG not DPRIVE
* When recursive resolver sends query to authorative, it sends the full query
* Using QNAME minimisation, the name is stripped up to one label before that which the server is authorative for:
* So, looking up `www.example.com`
** Root server sees request for `com`
** `com` server sees request for `example.com`
** Only `example.com` server sees full query

== DNS over HTTPS

* Each DNS query/response is a HTTP exchange
* Must use `https` URI scheme
** HTTP/2 is minimum recommended HTTP version
** SHOULD use 0 in DNS ID
* Client configured via URI template (RFC6570)
** `https://dnsserver.example.net/dns-query{?dns}`

== DNS over HTTPS

* Defined `application/dns-message` media type
** Same as the payload of a DNS UDP packet
** Maximum size 65535
** Door open to future definitions of alternate media types: DNS/JSON perhaps?
* HTTP cache control and DNS TTL need to be coordinated

[.notes]
--
`dns-message` media type is only one defined, but others in future not ruled
out. Suspect JSON media type will come along. Remember DNS TCP messages have
extra 2 bytes length header.

Mention here that DNS TTL and HTTP cache control have to be coordinated. HTTP cache
control MUST be <= shortest TTL in the message. = is RECOMMENDED.
Similarly, clients must take into account Age: headers and adjust received TTLs
accordingly.

* Chrome (Chromium, Bromite)
* curl
* _Intra_ Android app
* https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared[`cloudflared`]
* Various experimental
* http://getdnsapi.net[GetDNS/Stubby] in progress

== DoH: Server implementations

* `dnsdist` load balancer
* Knot resolver (branch)

== DoH in browsers

* OSs are slow to offer new DNS features
* "`We care about the privacy of our users`"
* "`Reduced latency within the browser`"

== Why DoH not DoT - Mozilla

[%step]
* Integration: "leverage the HTTP ecosystem"
* HTTPS everywhere: "`it works ... just use port 443, mix traffic`"
* Cool stuff:
** JSON
** Server push
** Get DNS from location other than configured resolver

== '`MoziFlare`'

[%step]
* "`We'd like to turn this on for all our users`"
* "`Cloudflare is our Trusted Recursive Resolver (TRR)`"
* "`.., we have a resolver we can trust to protect our users' privacy. This means
  *Firefox can ignore the resolver that the network provides* and just go
  straight to CloudFlare`"

== '`MoziFlare`' cont.

[%step]
* "`We won't check for DoH or DoT on the local resolver.`"
* "`... the problem we are attempting to solve here is attack on the user’s
   name resolution from an attacker with full or partial control of the
   network`"
* "`The user will be informed that we have enabled use of a TRR and
    have the opportunity to turn it off at that time, but will not be
    required to opt-in to get DoH with a TRR.`"

== Individual layer

[%step]
* Split between system and browser resolving
* Configure DNS  for each application?
* Breaks parental control service
* Informed consent
* What is best choice for user?

[.notes]
--
If user has VPN that sets resolver, resolving in browser breaks when VPN is up.

Contract with TalkTalk is based in the same legal juristiction, and
